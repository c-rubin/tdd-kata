## Step 1

firstly, I created a test class, and just made sure it worked correctly <br><br>

made new test, to check if api exists (ran it and failed it, as TDD demands)

successfuly passed the existing test (http code must be different from 404) <br><br>

made new test to check if api is successfuly responding (http code = 200)

successfuly passed above test <br><br>

in the next test, I will actually check if the response is a valid json
